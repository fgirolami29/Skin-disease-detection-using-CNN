# Skin-disease-detection-using-CNN
This repository contains a project aimed at detecting and classifying various skin diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging deep learning, this model processes skin images to identify potential conditions such as melanoma, acne, eczema, and more, offering a non-invasive tool to assist in early diagnosis.
